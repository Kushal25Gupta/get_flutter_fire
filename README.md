# Chess Central

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Saubhagya Singh, a Flutter developer with a deep passion for chess. When I was tasked with this project by Sharekhan, I chose to step beyond the conventional approach of creating standard clones or tutorial apps. Instead, I crafted something innovative by leveraging the essence of the boilerplate code provided by Mr. Anshuman Das.

In my previous projects, I utilized the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) file system. For this project, however, I embraced a more advanced architecture: Bindings-Views-Controllers (BVC). This sophisticated approach, along with a structured folder system for services and widgets, enables a cleaner and more efficient development process.

### Design and Assets

I have included the Excalidraw file, which contains the base design and wireframe of the app. Most of the images used in the app are Gemini-generated to avoid copyright issues, and the app's logo was designed using Canva.

### APIs Utilized

For real-time data integration, the following APIs have been used:
- [FIDE API](https://app.fide.com/api/docs): Provides access to FIDE-related data and player information.
- [Chess.com API](https://api.chess.com/pub/): Offers real-time chess data, including player profiles and game statistics.

A big thank you to the creators of these APIs for providing such valuable resources.
